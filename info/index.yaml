 This is the RESTful API definition of Onepanel component of Onedata data management system [http://www.onedata.org].

 This API allows control and configuration of local Onedata deployment, in particular full control over the Onezone and Oneprovider services and their distribution on the local resources. 

 Onezone and Oneprovider services is composed of 3 types of processes: managers, databases and workers. 

 Each of these processes can be added on specified host in the local site using this API. 

 The overall configuration can be controlled by updating 'onezone/configuration' and
 'oneprovider/configuration' resources.
  All paths listed below are relative to the base Onedata REST API which is `/api/v3/`, so complete URL for a request to Onepanel service is:
  
  ```
  http://HOSTNAME:PORT/api/v3/onepanel/...
  ```

  ## Authentication
  Onepanel supports only HTTP basic authentication, i.e. using `username` and `password` which were set when creating users.

  

  ## API structure
