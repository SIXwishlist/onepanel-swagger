 This is the RESTful API definition of Onepanel component of Onedata data management system [http://www.onedata.org].

 This API allows control and configuration of local Onedata deployment, in particular full control over the Onezone and Oneprovider services and their distribution on the local resources. 

 Onezone and Oneprovider services is composed of 3 types of processes: managers, databases and workers. 

 Each of these processes can be added on specified host in the local site using this API. 

 The overall configuration can be controlled by updating 'onezone/configuration' and
 'oneprovider/configuration' resources.

  ## Authentication
  In order to be able to use this API the REST client must be able to authenticate with the Onezone service.

  Currently this is supported through access token which can be generate using the Onedata user interface. 
  The token must be added to the request header:
  ```

  ```
